cloudflare-s2s is a dockerized setup with web UI to open a cloudflare warp 
tunnel and set up a wirguard VPN through this tunnel. 
The resulting key benefits are:

* Full privacy with wireguard tunnel in tunnel (not visible for cloudflare)
* Easy web UI management of multi site tunnels and users 
* Includes network address translation to cope with same subnets (NAT)
* Dockerized application with only minor

* only IPv4
